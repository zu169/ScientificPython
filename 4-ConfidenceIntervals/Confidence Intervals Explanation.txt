How does your result relate to the confidence level you asked for?

In statistical hypothesis testing, a confidence level represents the level of confidence or certainty we have in the result. 
It indicates the probability that the true population parameter (in this case, the population mean) falls within the calculated confidence interval.
So, when you calculate the confidence interval multiple times (as instructed in step f), you are essentially conducting repeated sampling and interval estimation. 
The question is asking you to analyze the relationship between the percentage of times the confidence interval captures the population mean 
and the confidence level you initially selected (in this case, a confidence level of 95%).
If your result shows that a high percentage of the intervals (close to 95 out of 100 intervals) capture the population mean, it suggests that the confidence level you chose is appropriate. 
It means that 95% of the time, when you use this method to estimate the population mean, the interval you construct will contain the true population mean.
However, if your result shows that a lower percentage of the intervals capture the population mean (e.g., significantly less than 95 out of 100 intervals), 
it implies that the confidence level you selected may be too high. 
In this case, the intervals are wider, resulting in a greater chance of capturing the population mean. 
You may need to adjust the confidence level to achieve a better balance between precision and certainty.
In summary, the question asks you to evaluate whether your experimental result aligns with the confidence level you initially specified 
and to consider whether adjustments to the confidence level may be necessary based on the observed percentage of intervals capturing the population mean.
